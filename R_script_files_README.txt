This is a readme file for the 4 plotn.R files required by the week 1 project in Exploratory Data Analysis (John Hopkins on Coursera).

The four files are:

1. plot1.R,
2. plot2.R,
3. plot3.R,
4. plot4.R.

Each of these files is independent of the other.  Each is comprised of the following sections:

1. WORKING DIRECTORY AND LIBRARY CALLS
2. READ IN THE PROVIDED DATASET
3. EXTRACT LINES CONTAINING PERTINENT DATES
4. DATA CLEANING
5. CREATE plotn

Section 1 sets the working directory.  You will need to adapt this to your system.

Section 2 downloads the original data set.  If the original data set is already in your working directory, you can skip this section by putting "#" in front the lines of code.  Otherwise, it takes a few minutes to download the dataset.

Section 3 reads 50000 lines of the original data set at a time and extracts the required data.

Section 4 is code for cleaning the data.

Section 5 provides code for reproducing the required graphic.
